        <div class="tip">
            <h2>1. Start with Skincare</h2>

        <h1>Some Haircare Tips</h1>
        <div class="video-container">
        <div class="tip">
            <h2>1. Regular Trimming</h2>

            <h2>2. Use a Wide-Tooth Comb</h2>

        <div class="tip">
            <h2>3. Limit Heat Styling</h2>
            <p>Reduce the use of heat styling tools like straighteners and curling irons, as excessive heat can damage hair. When using heat styling tools, apply a heat protectant spray first.</p>
